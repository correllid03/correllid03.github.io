### Assignments

This repository currently features the combined work from Assignments 1 and 2 in a single notebook.

#### Assignment 1 & 2: Customer Data & Transaction Analysis

* **Notebook:** **[OM620_Assignment_1_and_2.ipynb](https://github.com/correllid03/DominicCorrell_OM620/blob/main/notebooks/OM620_Assignment_1_and_2.ipynb)**
* **Objective:** To analyze transaction data to identify sales trends and then merge it with customer demographic data to uncover key customer segments and spending patterns.

#### Key Findings & Accomplishments:

* **Data Cleaning:** Successfully loaded, inspected, and cleaned two separate datasets. Converted date columns, calculated new metrics (like `TotalPrice`), and handled data preparation for merging.
* **Trend Analysis (Assignment 1):**
    * Identified "Electronics" and "Clothing" as the top-grossing product categories.
    * Visualized monthly sales trends, showing seasonal patterns in revenue over time.
* **Customer Segmentation (Assignment 2):**
    * Successfully merged transaction and customer data to create a unified `df_merged` DataFrame.
    * Analyzed and visualized average customer spending by **Age Group** and **Location**.
    * Used boxplots to show the distribution of spending by **Gender**.

### 🚀 Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation (merging, grouping).
* **plotnine:** For creating declarative, high-quality data visualizations (bar charts, line plots, boxplots).
