This repository serves as a portfolio specifically documenting the assignments completed for the OM 620: Advanced Data Analytics at Cal State San Marcos in the Masters of Science Supply Chain Analytics program. These original assignments were actually done in collaboration with fellow students David Gibbs and Andres Castillo Zunigas, but what will be seen here is going to be my personal edits based on feedback on the original group submissions. As a result the notebooks may look different than the original group assignments that were turned in.

The 'Milestones' are specifically for setting up the GitHub website you are accessing this from, while the 'assignments' were practical data analysis exercises done in Python. Milestones are individual, while assignments have been group efforts. Much of what is done in OM620 may coincide in some ways with the OM 621 course, as Python is extensively used in that as well. However, that course emphasizes the visual presentation part of much of data analysis, while this course focuses primarily on the raw analysis component. Regardless, both build upon each other purely through the use of Python in both.

The core deliverable is a single, integrated Jupyter Notebook (OM620_Assignment_1_and_2.ipynb) that logically connects the goals and findings of both assignments.


Data Cleaning & Exploration (Assignment 1)
    Filtering: The initial dataset was cleaned by removing invalid transactions (negative price or quantity, and a lead time outlier) and then filtered to focus solely on 140,394 transactions for Finished Goods (FG) that are Make-to-Stock (MTS).

    Scope: The analyzed data covers 282 unique SKUs.
    
    Key Transaction: The highest single transaction by both order quantity (187 units) and total sales (around $187,704$) was for SKU F9D1D1FE.

Safety Stock (SS) Calculations (Assignment 2)
    Demand Aggregation: Demand statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) and average lead time were calculated for each of the 282 SKUs.

    Parametric SS: Safety Stock was determined using the parametric formula (based on the Normal distribution Z-score) for service levels of 75%, 90%, and 95%.

    Critical Findings (95% SL):
        Average Safety Stock: around 105.29 units across all SKUs.

        Largest SS: 337 units (SKU: 528EC5AC).

        Smallest SS: 32 units (SKU: 9ED24ECA).

    Non-Parametric SS (a 'Side-Quest'): 
        An alternative, non-parametric method using empirical quantiles was also calculated to provide safety stock estimates without assuming a normal demand distribution.
