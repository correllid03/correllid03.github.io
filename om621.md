# Assignment 1: The 3-Minute Story

### Understanding the Client and Constraints

**The Client:** Adrianne, Director of Supply Chain at Gear Hugger  
**Her Background:** Experienced in managing consumer packaged goods and eco-friendly products  
**Her Style:** No-nonsense, prefers clear communication and direct problem-solving  

**The Constraint:** Upper management gave Adrianne exactly **one month** to demonstrate measurable shipping cost reduction.

### The Business Problem

Gear Hugger faces significant costs transporting hazardous material small parcels to Amazon Fulfillment Centers through third-party carriers like UPS. While the company is a notable eco-friendly startup, the hazmat classification of certain products creates premium shipping costs that impact profitability.

**Variables to Consider:**
- Product line sales figures on Amazon Seller Central
- Shipping costs per product line to Amazon FCs
- Comparative rates: UPS vs. FedEx vs. other 3PLs
- Geographic variance: shipping to different FC locations
- Amazon placement fees for seller-directed inventory
- Manufacturing costs and margins per product line
- Estimated delivery times for inventory replenishment
- Labor costs per shipment
- Direct-to-consumer costs through smaller retailers (REI, Grove, etc.)

### The Analytical Journey

**Initial Hypothesis:**  
Compare UPS and FedEx rates to find cheaper carrier options. Expected outcome: 5-8% cost savings through carrier switching.

**What the Data Revealed:**  
After analyzing shipping patterns, a more significant opportunity emerged: **geographic optimization**.

A shipment to **Rialto, CA** costs substantially less than one to **Indianapolis, IN**—even accounting for Amazon's $30 placement fee for seller-directed routing. The cost differential based on destination geography far exceeded potential carrier rate savings.

### The Strategic Process

![Analysis Storyboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/correllid03/OM621Assignments/main/plots/storyboard.png)

**Step 1: Evaluate Adrianne**  
- Understand her experience with CPG and eco-friendly products
- Recognize her preference for direct communication
- Account for the one-month timeline constraint

**Step 2: Gather Variables**  
- Shipping rates and cost data
- Amazon FC locations and placement fees
- Product line profitability metrics
- Delivery time requirements

**Step 3: Compile Conclusions**  
- Geography matters more than carrier choice for cost reduction
- West Coast FCs (Rialto, Phoenix) offer substantially lower costs
- Prioritizing product lines with better margin-to-shipping ratios

**Step 4: Present Plan to Adrianne**  
- Short-term: Optimize shipment routing to West Coast facilities
- Medium-term: Compare carriers by individual shipment route
- Long-term: Consider product line adjustments away from hazmat classifications

### The Recommendation

**For the One-Month Deadline:**

Prioritize sending small parcel deliveries to **West Coast fulfillment centers** (Rialto, Phoenix, etc.) despite higher Amazon placement fees. The geographic cost savings exceed placement fee costs.

**Why This Works:**
1. **Implementable immediately** - routing changes take days, not months
2. **No capital investment** - uses existing Amazon Seller Central tools
3. **Measurable impact** - can demonstrate cost reduction within the deadline
4. **Low operational disruption** - doesn't require process changes

**Supporting Actions:**
- Review carrier rates by specific route (UPS vs. FedEx per shipment)
- Prioritize high-margin product lines for replenishment
- Monitor geography-based cost differences to refine routing strategy

**Long-term Consideration:**  
Product line divestment away from hazardous materials offers the ultimate cost reduction, but requires longer implementation timeline beyond Adrianne's one-month constraint.
## Executive Summary

This project analyzes transportation cost optimization for a multi-regional distribution network operating across Asia-Pacific, Americas, and EMEA. Using over 100,000 shipment records from 2022-2024, the analysis identifies key cost drivers, quantifies regional variance, and develops mode-specific forecasting models.

**Primary Question:** Where can we achieve the greatest cost reduction in our global logistics network?

**Key Findings:**
- Regional cost variance of 40-50% for equivalent shipments across modes
- Less Than Container Load (LCL) operations represent the largest cost driver across all regions
- Mode-specific forecasting required due to distinct seasonal patterns
- Invoice delay patterns vary by mode, impacting cash flow forecasting

**Business Impact:** Analysis identifies $180M+ in potential annual savings through strategic routing optimization and mode selection.

## The Analysis Story

### The Challenge

A global distribution network operates three major facilities:
- **Chon Buri, Thailand** (APAC) - $349M annual transportation spend
- **Cincinnati, USA** (AMER) - $405M annual transportation spend  
- **Guangzhou, China** (APAC) - $357M annual transportation spend

With over $1.1 billion in annual transportation costs, the organization sought to understand:
1. Which transportation modes drive the highest costs?
2. How do costs vary across regions for the same service levels?
3. Can we predict cost trends to improve budgeting accuracy?
4. Where should we focus optimization efforts for maximum impact?

### The Approach

Rather than simply comparing carrier rates—the traditional approach—this analysis took a comprehensive view of the cost structure:

**Step 1: Data Validation**  
Assessed data quality across 100,000+ shipment records, validating invoice dates, delivery dates, and cost allocations.

**Step 2: Cost Pattern Analysis**  
Decomposed total transportation spend by:
- Transportation mode (LCL, FCL, Air, Ground, Parcel)
- Geographic region (AMER, APAC, EMEA)
- Site-level operations
- Temporal trends (monthly, seasonal)

**Step 3: Delay Impact Assessment**  
Analyzed invoice delay patterns to understand cash flow implications and operational efficiency metrics.

**Step 4: Predictive Modeling**  
Developed mode-specific forecasting models accounting for seasonal patterns and regional variations.

### Key Discoveries

#### Finding 1: Regional Cost Disparities

The same shipment profile shows dramatically different costs depending on destination region:

| Transportation Mode | AMER Cost | APAC Cost | EMEA Cost | Variance |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Less Than Container Load | Higher | Baseline | Medium | 40-50% |
| Full Container Load | Higher | Lower | Medium | 35-45% |
| Expedited Air | Variable | Variable | Variable | 20-30% |

**Insight:** Geographic optimization offers larger savings than carrier negotiation alone.

#### Finding 2: Mode-Specific Cost Behavior

Different transportation modes exhibit completely different patterns:

**Container Modes (LCL/FCL):**
- Represent 65%+ of total transportation spend
- Show consistent regional patterns
- Display predictable capacity constraints
- Longer invoice delay cycles (30+ days)

**Air Modes:**
- Highly volatile, event-driven cost spikes
- Limited seasonal predictability  
- Faster invoice processing
- Premium pricing for expedited service

**Ground/Parcel:**
- Clear Q4 seasonal peaks (holiday shipping)
- Moderate regional variance
- Predictable cost forecasting
- Standard invoice timing

**Implication:** Cannot use a single forecasting model for all modes—each requires mode-specific approach.

#### Finding 3: Site-Level Performance Variance

**Chon Buri (Thailand):**
- Average delay: 27.00 days
- Strength: APAC regional distribution
- Opportunity: LCL cost optimization

**Cincinnati (USA):**  
- Average delay: 18.96 days
- Strength: Faster invoice processing
- Opportunity: AMER-EMEA routing efficiency

**Guangzhou (China):**
- Average delay: 26.88 days  
- Strength: Manufacturing proximity
- Opportunity: Container consolidation

### The Recommendation

**Primary Strategy: Geographic Routing Optimization**

Instead of focusing solely on carrier rate negotiations (5-8% potential savings), prioritize strategic routing decisions based on regional cost structures (40-50% potential savings on affected shipments).

**Implementation Framework:**

**Phase 1 (Immediate - 30 days):**
- Audit current shipment routing patterns
- Identify shipments with highest regional cost variance
- Prioritize lower-cost regions for non-time-sensitive freight

**Phase 2 (Short-term - 90 days):**
- Implement mode-specific forecasting models
- Adjust budget allocations by mode and region
- Account for invoice delay patterns in cash flow planning

**Phase 3 (Long-term - 6-12 months):**
- Evaluate site-level capacity optimization
- Consider strategic facility placement
- Develop carrier partnerships optimized by region

**Projected Impact:**
- Annual savings potential: $180M+ across network
- Implementation cost: Minimal (routing logic changes only)
- Risk: Low (leverages existing infrastructure)
